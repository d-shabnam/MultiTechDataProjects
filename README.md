Here, you'll find a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in various analytical tools.

1. PowerBIproject1:
   In this folder you will find 3 excel files ("Müştəri-Məhsul", "Stock", " "Sales", "description" (for guide)), 1 Power BI file and folder that contains 4 sales files for different years.

After cleaning process, I followed all the steps in "description" file.
